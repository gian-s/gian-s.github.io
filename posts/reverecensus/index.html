Our semester long project was working with city officials in Revere, Massachusetts in order to track the use of city services by the demographics of the area.\nRole The team was tasked with being able to geospatially merge data that was collected from various city services to census tracts. If we can track city services by Census tracts, then we can see if lower-income/minority populated areas are being given the same attention/resources compared to other areas of the City of Revere.\nI used libraries such as GeoPandas, Folium, Google Maps API, excel, and NumPy in order to get coordinates of the addresses given, merge them with shape files given from the United States Census, and create visualizations to overlap city data and demographic data. I was also in charge of maintaining the Github repository and a JupyterHub server in order to organize the various Jupyter Notebooks and different visualizations generated.\nResults We did not have enough time to provide a meaningful statistical analysis of trying to find discrepancies between city services in Revere. What we were able to provide was to establish data pipelines that the City of Revere can use in the future to locate how city services are distributed by Census tracts or groups. We provided code to help generate meaningful visualizations that can be easily modified and adapted to fit the city’s needs. Future work that could have been potentially done is to create infrastructure in order to automate the generation of visualizations of city data whenever new data is created. The city would have also greatly benefitted from creating an overall centralized database system where city services can upload, store and modify data as they see fit. The final report can be viewed here.\n","wordCount":"307","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://gian-s.github.io/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"2021-05-12T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2021-05-12T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"City of Revere"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://gian-s.github.io/posts/reverecensus/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Giancarlo Sirio","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://gian-s.github.io/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://gian-s.github.io/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)">Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://gian-s.github.io/posts title=projects><span>projects</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li><li><a href=https://gian-s.github.io/tags/ title=resume><span>resume</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://gian-s.github.io/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://gian-s.github.io/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">City of Revere Data Analysis</h1><div class=post-description>Exploratory data analysis on whether or not racial disparities are present in the use of city services such as garbage collection, tracking violations, housing violation, etc.</div><div class=post-meta><span title='2021-05-12 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>May 2021</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;2 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;City of Revere&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Edit</a></div></header><div class=toc><details><summary accesskey=c title="(Alt + C)"><span class=details>Table of Contents</span></summary><div class=inner><ul><li><a href=#summary aria-label=Summary>Summary</a></li><li><a href=#role aria-label=Role>Role</a></li><li><a href=#results aria-label=Results>Results</a></li></ul></div></details></div><div class=post-content><h3 id=summary><strong>Summary</strong><a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#summary>#</a></h3><p>Semester-long project worked on a team of 6 for Computational Tools for Data Science at Boston University CS506.
