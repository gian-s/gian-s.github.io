A system that can accurately detect certain metrics of these recordings would effectively save a lot of time for a speech pathologist that must listen to so many hours of audio recordings.

The audio data we would be working with would be noisy data, therefore we wanted to create baseline models we could compare our results to by using recordings of sentences that had been manually transcribed. The models I created were capable of handling text and audio data. The feature extraction for both data types were done separately and was something that my mentor and I had experimented with. I was able to replicate the models used in the paper and establish some baseline results that were comparable to those found in the paper. We later wanted to see how well newer Neural Network Architectures, such as Transformers would be able to handle text as well as audio features in our classification. I used transfer learning, with the help of some large Transformer models in order to fine tune the model to our set classification problem.
